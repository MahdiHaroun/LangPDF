# Icon Placeholder Files

The Chrome extension requires icon files in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons with a simple design featuring:
- A document/PDF icon with a chat bubble
- Blue and green color scheme to match the app
- Clear visibility at small sizes

For now, placeholder files would be needed in this directory.

You can create these icons using:
1. Online icon generators
2. Design tools like Figma, Canva, or GIMP
3. Simple SVG to PNG conversion tools

The icons should represent the RAG PDF Chat functionality with:
- ðŸ“„ Document symbol
- ðŸ’¬ Chat bubble
- ðŸ¤– AI/robot elements
